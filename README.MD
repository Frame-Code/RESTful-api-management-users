# RESTful-api-management-users 

A basic backend development project to create a functional API REST to manage only users, 
their authentication (log in and sign up) and the different endpoints to work with the users,
so you can edit them, delete them, reset the default password and filter users by 'x' value.

## FEATURES
The main technologies used in this project are:
- **Spring boot framework** for easy creation of the web application general
- **Spring data jpa and hibernate orm** for a easy manage data to persist
- **Spring security** to add layers to security to the application, as user roles and permissions,
login and user registration management, and user session management
- **JWT** for token management that will manage user session facilitating secure client-server communication
  (for each login, the api returns the respective access token and refresh token).
- **SB admin 2 template** for the frontend side to make a mora complete and graphical use of the api
